</pre>

### Features

1. **Video Feed** Integrated firebase, and a feed similar to instagram. Users can see dynamically updated video content in form of a scrollable feed.

1. **Haptic Vibration** Whenever a user changes the focus on another video, he/she will precieve a haptic interaction.

1. **Auto mute** If a user taps to unmute one of the videos in the feed, the previously unmuted video will automatically get muted ðŸ˜‰

1. **Caching** All the videos that you play are automatically cached on the user's device smartly, so that you don't need to worry about bandwidth costs, also the cache will be cleared automatically, once it exceeds a limit of 800MB.

1. **Multiple Aspect Ratios** The Video Player Component will automatically resize itself to Aspect ratio of the video. So, no more cropping ;)

1. **Playing from custom url** Don't like the videos in the feed? You can just type or paste any video url and see it in action.

1. **Advanced Controls** Seek, pause, play, rewind, forward, change volumes whatever you want and even natural gestures such as drag to dismiss video.

1. **Beautiful, yet simplistic UI** Every single interaction in the app is crafted with lots of love to feel as user-friendly as possible.
